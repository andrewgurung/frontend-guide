## A Look Into Proper HTML5 Semantics
- Semantics is the study of meaning not mere structures/syntax
- Proper semantics lead to better SEO and accessibility to screen readers

### Semantic Elements Before HTML5
- `form`, `img`, `table`, `ul`, `h1`, `h2` etc
- Nobody puts a table inside an `img` tag
- But `table` was widely misused to structure webpage instead of representing data

### Non-Semantic Elements
- `div` and `span` are the most common non-semantic tags

### Text Semantics in HTML5
- `em`, `strong`, `time` for human readable date times, `mark` for highlighted text

### Document Outline in HTML5
In HTML5 the document can be outlined by new sectioning elements,
- `<section>` for sections grouped around a specific theme
- `<article>` for complete or self-contained compositions such as a blog post or a widget
- `<nav>` for navigation blocks
- `<aside>` for complementary content such as sidebars
-  Each section (body, section, article, aside, nav) can have their own `<header>` and `<footer>` tags

NOTES: 
- OLD Sectioning element: `<body>`
- `<nav>` and`<aside>` tags don't belong to the main outline of the HTML document. Usually not rendered initially by assistive technologies
- Each section has its own heading hierarchy. Each of them (even the innermost nested section) can have an h1 tag
- A Semantic Outline example:
