Notes

## Site Structure
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to give websites structure with text, links, images, and other fundamental elements
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change the appearance of HTML elements
- There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6
- Adding video
```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="video-url.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```
## A Closer Look at CSS
- CSS is a language used to style websites
- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css"/>`

CSS can be divided into 3 parts:
1. rule: a list of CSS instructions for how to style a specific HTML element or group of HTML elements
2. selector: specifies exactly which HTML elements to style
3. properties and values: located inside the { } brackets, properties and values specify what aspect of the selector to style

- Changing font: `font-family: Palatino, 'Palatino Linotype', serif;`
- Background image" `background-image: url("image.jpg");`
- Background image color: `background-size: cover;`
- Ids have greater specificity than classes
