Notes
-----------------
## The "display" property
- CSS's most important property for controlling layout
- The default for most elements is usually `block` or `inline`

### block
- Starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can
- `display: block`
- div, footer, header, p, form

### inline
- Can wrap text without disrupting the flow
- `display: inline`
- span

### none
- Will render the page as though the element does not exist
- `display: none`
- Better than `visibility: hidden` which will take space even if it is hidden
- `script` use this as their default
